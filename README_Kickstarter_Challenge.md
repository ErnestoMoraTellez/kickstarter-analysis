# Kickstarting analysis based on launch dates and funding goals

## Overview of Project
Louise wants to start a fundign for her play FEVER, she's estimating around $10,000+. We have several data about kickstarters from different countries, times, goals, categories, etc., and she wants help in order to identify what factors make a campaing successful.
### Purpose
We want to find the correlation between launch dates, funding goals and outcome of the kickstarters. This should let us see the more successful date to release the play and the amount of funding goal that made the play successful.
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
![Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch](C:\Users\emora\OneDrive\Data analysis\Modulo1\resources)
On this graph we can see that the best three months to launch the play are May, June and July becasuse the difference between the successful one and the failed one is bigger. The month with more successful plays is May, but also is the month with more number of plays. This means that May is the month with the higher probability of success, but also the amount of failed plays is bigger compared to the other months. The worst date to launch a play is December, almost 50% of the plays fail.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
![Outcomes_vs_Goals](C:\Users\emora\OneDrive\Data analysis\Modulo1\resources)
On this graph we can see that the plays with goals between 0 and 4999 have the higher percentage of successful. The range of "Less that 1000" has 76% of success, this make this option the better one. Also most of the plays have a goal between 0 and 4999, so Louise should consider this as the best option.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Some times the graphs give us some idea or picture, but it's not enough. I needed to complement the information using the table. The use of percentages makes easier to identify tendencies. In the case of the outcomes vs launch date, we can complement with the percentage of the successful and failed plays.
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
May is the best option to launch the play. But is the month with more plays. This also means that there are more failed plays on this month. 
December is the worst month to realease a play because it's almost a 50-50. The lowest probability of success in this case.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
The better goal to set is betweemm 0 and 4999. Most of the plays are on this range and they have over 70% of success.
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
It includes a lot of data about kickstaters, it's not only for plays, that's why we don't have a lot of details on this category. We can delve into the genres of the plays, number of sold tickets, type of theater/instalations, hour of the play, etc.
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Percentage of success vs launch date[Table]
Percentage of success vs cost of the tickets [table/graph]
Amount of sold tickets vs genres[table/graph]
